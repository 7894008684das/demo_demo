My name is Abhishek das from Odisha Balasore. I completed my graduation in 2020 with physics honours.
Along with my graduation, I completed python, Data science, Build a Modern Computer from First Principles courses on Coursera.
I got a certificate from Microsoft in the AI classroom series.
I am doing an internship at Ineuron. The project name is Environmental sensors analysis.
In this project, we work on live data from sensors like light, pressure, temperature, humidity, rain sensor.
The main problem we face that we do not have pre-collected data for EDA and train the machine learning model and make an ai dashboard.
That's why we collect data from a weather station. In this weather station dataset, we make a time series model.
It was during this project that I discovered that I am a team player.
I want to be who I am.
I love to play video games, make youtube
